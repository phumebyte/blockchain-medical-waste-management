## Blockchain Medical Waste Management
This project leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize the management of medical waste by enhancing transparency, traceability, and compliance. It aims to tackle key challenges such as improper waste disposal, fraud, and regulatory gaps, which pose risks to public health and the environment. Our project integrates blockchain to track the lifecycle of waste, including classification, and waste management of medical supplies.

# Our Project - MediWasteWatch
## Inspiration
Medical waste management presents a critical challenge due to the hazardous nature of the waste and its potential impact on public health and the environment. The complexity of ensuring proper disposal and compliance with stringent regulations globally adds to the problem. Blockchain technology, known for its decentralised, transparent, and tamper-proof ledger system, has the potential to transform medical waste management, making it more efficient, compliant, and safe.

## Current Climate of Medical Waste Management
The global community faces significant challenges in managing medical waste, which impacts public health and increases the risk of epidemics. Here's a breakdown of the situation:
#### Lack of a Global Policy
- There is no unified global policy guiding medical waste management across countries, creating inconsistencies in practices.
#### Poor Waste Management Practices
- Improper handling and disposal occur at multiple stages—from generation to final disposal, contributing to illegal dumping in unapproved areas.
- Non-enforcement of existing guidelines further aggravates the problem in provinces where regulations exist.
#### Inadequate Disposal Infrastructure
- Authorized disposal sites are overwhelmed by the volume of medical waste, leading to improper storage and delayed processing.
- Facilities for temporary storage of waste are limited, resulting in inefficiencies along the disposal chain.
#### Resource Constraints
- The healthcare system is resource-constrained, which limits the ability to handle medical waste efficiently.
  
## Why a Blockchain-Based System Like Ours is Needed
Our blockchain-powered platform does not aim to replace existing institutions but complements and supports them by ensuring transparency, traceability, and compliance. Here's how it addresses current challenges:

**Transparency and Accountability:** <br/>
  Every step in the waste lifecycle is recorded on the blockchain, providing a tamper-proof audit trail that ensures waste is handled legally and ethically. <br/>
  <br/>
**Policy Support and Enforcement:** <br/>
  Automated smart contracts ensure compliance with evolving waste management regulations, even in provinces with fragmented guidelines. <br/>
  <br/>
**Efficient Collaboration:** <br/>
  The system connects all stakeholders—from healthcare providers to waste disposal companies—enabling secure data exchange and coordination. <br/>
  <br/>
**Relieving Pressure on Infrastructure:** <br/>
  Predictive analytics help optimize waste collection schedules and usage of authorized disposal sites, reducing bottlenecks. <br/>
  <br/>
**Encouraging Sustainability:** <br/>
  Token-based incentives promote sustainable practices and ensure compliance, improving the healthcare industry’s environmental footprint.<br/>

## User Profiles
These user stories outline the flow of activities from supply delivery to final disposal, with blockchain entries tracking every step. Each role is distinct, ensuring accountability and transparency.

## UX/UI Design
Welcome to MediWasteWatch, here is a walkthrough of the UI design:
https://youtu.be/u-YYaVulf64 

The chosen colour palette consists of orange shades and pops of green for buttons. These represent alerts for hazardous medical waste and the safe management and disposal of this waste. The typography is clean and readable, with a hierarchy between headings and field labels to guide the user. The chosen font pairing is Roboto for all headings and Open Sans for body text. This is a professional pairing and highlights the tone of the web app.The vertical layout of this presentation emphasises the responsive mobile-first design approach.

- The onboarding page features a clean, mobile-friendly design with an intuitive form with labelled input fields. The bold logo and tagline establish brand identity, while the green "Register" button is a bright green for a clear call-to-action. 
- The following page has a list of our collaborators with awesome use of whitespace and relevant images. It introduces the user to the involved parties to set the tone of the blockchain tracking process. 
- During the tracking process (medical supply lifecycle), the pages have a clear scan call-to-action that will reveal a modal with all the product details. There is consistent font sizing and great use of spacing and alignment. All input fields are clearly labelled and the text boxes contain examples and/or clear instructions for the user. 
- The final page is item scan history which will generate a certificate of disposal. This page utilises the space to show all the information related to the product.

## Tech Stack Used
We are building our blockchain medical waste management system using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—because it’s a flexible, scalable, and beginner-friendly technology stack. Here’s a quick summary of the benefits:

- **JavaScript Everywhere**: Both the frontend and backend are in JavaScript, simplifying development and speeding up our learning process. 
- **MongoDB for Storage**: A NoSQL database that easily stores and manages complex data like waste tracking logs and blockchain entries.
- **Express.js & Node.js for Backend**: These ensure fast API development and smooth handling of multiple operations, such as scanning and logging waste transactions.
- **React for UI**: React helps us create responsive, reusable components, making the app intuitive and easy to use.

## Competitor Analysis
Our solution bridges the gap between research and real-world application. We offer a fully functional, scalable web app that uses blockchain to track waste across the entire lifecycle. In addition to tracking and compliance, we introduce real-time scan data logging, and smart contracts to distribute token incentives. Our platform is cost-effective and adaptable for healthcare facilities of all sizes, setting it apart from competitors by focusing on usability, sustainability, and practical deployment. Here are some of our research based competitors: 
1. IBM Blockchain Solutions
- Focus on healthcare data management (patient records, workflows) rather than waste management.
- Designed for large enterprises with complex needs, involving higher costs and overhead.
- Potentially adaptable to waste tracking, but not optimized for smaller healthcare facilities​

2. Medical-Waste Chain (Conceptual Project)
- A research project proposing the use of blockchain to track medical waste from delivery to disposal.
- Uses Hyperledger Fabric for decentralized tracking and smart contracts for compliance.
- Not a live app—remains in the academic phase, with no public deployment or working prototype​

3. Research-Based Blockchain Solutions (Walsh Medical Media)
- Pilot studies explore blockchain token rewards for hospitals practicing sustainable waste management.
- Solutions remain largely theoretical or early-stage, without full real-world implementation​

## Conclusion
As global medical waste generation continues to increase, the adoption of blockchain technology offers a promising solution to the challenges of inefficiency, compliance, and safety in medical waste management. The transparency, traceability, and automation capabilities of blockchain can help healthcare facilities streamline waste disposal processes, enhance compliance with regulations, and promote sustainable practices. By doing so, blockchain could revolutionise how we handle medical waste, protecting both the public and the environment.
